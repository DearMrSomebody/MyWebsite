					<h3 class="about-header">Childhood</h3>
						<p class="about-line-height">
							Keyla Jones grew up in Arizona, where she was homeschooled alongside her three brothers. While her brothers spent their time taking apart anything they could get their hands on, Keyla spent her time dreaming up new stories, writing songs, and drawing.
						</p>
				<br>
						<p>
							During her time in sunny Arizona, her mother/teacher noticed that she was really struggling with reading and quickly found out she was dyslexic.
						</p>
				<br>
						<p class="about-line-height">
							Instead of backing down, her mother made Keyla work 10x harder to overcome dyslexia, and also encourged her to work on the things she enjoyed, writing.
						</p>
				<br>
						<p class="about-line-height">
							After a lot of hard work and tears, Keyla graduated college with a 3.9 GPA, wrote and directed an award-winning play, and has completed two 79,000 word novels, with many more in-progress.
						</p>
				<br>
						<p class="about-line-height">
							Her stories are inspired by her vivid dreams and her own experiences. She strives to be a rolemodel for young writers struggling with dyslexia.
						</p>

					<h3 class="about-header">Current Days</h3>
